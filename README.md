# FiveM NPC Script

## Description
This script allows you to define multiples NPCs in your FiveM server and control their behavior. It is designed to be used in a "quest" or mission environment, where you may want to interact with NPCs for various purposes.

## Features
- Define multiple NPCs with different positions, rotations, animations, and behaviors.
- You can add a interaction with the NPCs using a key press.

## Installation
1. Download the script from the repository.
2. Place the contents in the `resources` folder of your FiveM server in a folder named `wiibleyde_npc_quest`.
3. Add `ensure wiibleyde_npc_quest` to your `server.cfg` file.

## Configuration
All the configuration is done in the `config.lua` file. You can define your NPCs and their properties there. (It's easy to understand, just look at the example in the file)

## Controls
- `E` - **Near the NPC**: Interact with the NPC (if defined in the config).
